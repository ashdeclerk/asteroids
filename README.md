# Asteroids
This project was made as part of the boot.dev curriculum. It's a basic
implementation of the game Asteroids in pygame.

# TODO
There are lots of things that I might do at some point, but likely not for
a long time:
- [ ] Add scoring
- [ ] Fix the ship's hitbox
    - Currently this is a circle rather than the triangle that's being drawn
- [ ] Add powerups
- [ ] Add acceleration and inertia
- [ ] Add screenwrap (or at least delete things that go off screen)
- [ ] Improve graphics
- [ ] Switch from exiting on game over to having an actual game over screen
- [ ] Add intro screen
